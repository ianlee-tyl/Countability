# Countability

Countability is a productivity social media app. In essence, it allows your friends to be the ones who motivate you to become more productive. 

Simply start sign up, and start a work session with a timer. After that, feel free to leave the Countability site and do work on your labtop. When it is time to "check" your work, the site will send an alert to you, where you can screenshot or upload a photo displaying your current work progress. Each successful session is converted to a social media post (like BeReal, but for productivity).

Moreover, as you power through your work sessions, you earn pixel points that allow you to create pixel arts, which can in turn be shown to the community!
